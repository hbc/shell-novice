## Introduction to vim 
Vim is a very powerful text editor, and it offers extensive text editing options. However, in this introduction, we are just going to explore vim at a basic level. But, be aware, that there is a lot of functionality that we are not going to examine during this current session. 

You have learned how to create a file in Unix using the `touch` command, but you can also create a document by calling a text editor and providing the name of the document you wish to create. To create a document in vim entitled "draft.txt", let's type `vi draft.txt` in the terminal.

#### Vim interface

Notice the "draft.txt" [New File] typed at the bottom left-hand section of the screen. This tells you that you just created a new file in vim. 

#### Vim modes
Vim has **_two basic modes_** that will allow you to create documents and edit your text:   

- **_command mode (default mode):_** will allow you to save and quit the program (and execute other more advanced commands).  

- **_insert (or edit) mode:_** will allow you to write and edit text


Upon creation of a file, vim is automatically in command mode. Let's change to insert mode by typing `i`. Notice the **--INSERT--** at the bottom left hand of the screen. Now type in a few lines of text:

After you have finished your typing, press `esc` to enter command mode. Notice the **--INSERT--** disappeared from the bottom of the screen.

#### Vim saving and quitting
To write to file (save), type `:w`. You can see the commands you type in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen.

After you have saved the file, the total number of lines and characters in the file will print out at the bottom left-hand section of the screen.

Alternatively, we can write to file (save) and quit. Let's do that by typing `:wq`.

Now, you should have exited vim and returned back to your terminal window.

To edit your "draft.txt" document, open up the file by calling vim and entering the file name: `vi draft.txt`. Change to insert mode and type a few more lines (you can move around the lines using the arrows on the keyboard):

We decide not to save our changes. We can quit without saving by typing `:q!` in the command mode. 

#### Vim editing
Create the document "spider.txt" in vi. Enter the text as follows:

To make it easier to refer to distinct lines, we can add line numbers by typing `:set number`. Later, if you choose to remove the line numbers you can type `:set nonumber`.

While we cannot point and click to navigate the document, we can use the arrow keys to move around, however, it is very slow. Vim has shortcuts for moving around that you can test out. While in command mode, try moving around the screen using the following commands (which are completely unintuitive):    

	`gg`: move to top of file  
	`G`: move to bottom of file  
	`0`: move to beginning of line  
	`$`: move to end of line  
	`w`: move to next word
	`b`: move to previous word

In addition to shortcuts for navigation, vim also offers editing shortcuts, such as the following:

	`dw`: delete word 
	`dd`: delete line  
	`u`: undo
	`Ctrl + u`: redo
	
Practice some of the editing shortcuts, then, quit the document without saving any changes.

#### Vim challenge
We have covered some basic commands in vim, but practice is key for getting comfortable with the program. Let's practice what we just learned in a brief challenge.

1. Open spider.txt, and delete the word "water" from line #2.
3. Quit without saving.
4. Open vi_challenge.txt again, and delete "Out came the sun and dried up all the rain, and the itsy bitsy spider went up the spout again." 
5. Save the file.
6. Undo your previous deletion.
7. Redo your previous deletion.
8. Delete the first and last words from all lines.
9. Save the file and post contents to the Etherpad.
